# can-i-get-there

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ This app is still under construction. ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

### Why I'm making this
The inspiration for this project was this Vice documentary https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XT5x6cx4mE&ab_channel=VICENews. Hearing the stories of wheelchair-bound passengers on New York's subways made me realize the struggles of accessibility in one of America's wealthiest cities. 

This app is an accessibility tool to help people find out if MTA subway stations have operational ADA-compliant elevators. Elevators undergoing maintenance or elevators that randomly stop working are a daily occurence, yet the MTA's site is extremely slow and often difficult to use to simply check if elevators at specific stations are functioning properly. Going to a subway stop thinking an elevator is operational to discover it isn't poses a major inconvenience to those that rely on them to travel around the city.

### Features
- Fetching data from an API to pull real-time elevator data (updated every 5 minutes by the MTA)
- Input to search amongst the 472 NYC subway stations to find out if:
  - if elevators exist at that station
  - if the elevators there are ADA compliant
  - if the elevators there are currently functioning, and if not, provide the reason and/or scheduled maintenance dates

### Disclaimer
This project is in no way affiliated with the MTA.
